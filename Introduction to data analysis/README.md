# Introduction to data analysis project
During classes regarding introduction to data analysis I had the opportunity to learn the basic machine learning models, learn how to explore and clean the data and generally undestand the basics of EDA.
To summarize all the knowledge nad skills gained during the course me and two of my friends worked on a project exploring Movies dataset. See the results here. :)
