# Numerical methods for SDE project
During classes regarding Numerical methods for SDE I had the opportunity to learn the concept of SDEs and learn how to apply them in Python. Moreover, I got familiar with few numerical methods applicable for different SDEs.
At the end of the lectures I prepared a project on comparing different numerical methods to predict the AAPL stock prices modelled with a GBM model.
