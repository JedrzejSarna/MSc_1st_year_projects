# Projects during 1st year of Masters Degree
All projects that I have worked on during first year of my Master Degree in Statistical Data Analysis on AGH University in Krakow.
During the first year of my Master's Degree I had the opportunity to attend some very interesting courses including:

- Statistical Data Science
- Stochastic processes
- Introduction to databases
- Introduction to R
- Numerical methods for stochastic differential equations (SDE)
- Introduction to data analysis

In each of the courses listed above, I had the opportunity to do a smaller or larger project that I would like to share here :)
**Note: Most of the projects are done in polish language as my lectures are in polish.**
