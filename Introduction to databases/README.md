# Introduction to databases project
During classes regarding databases I had the opportunity to learn the basics of SQL language, the idea of databases and how to manage and/or manipulate them. At the end of the lectures we prepared a project concerning
Database normalization (a process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity).
