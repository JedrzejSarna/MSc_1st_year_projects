During classes with professor Hernando Ombao from King Abdullah University, me and my friends Weronika and Mateusz had the opportunity to create a project involving exploratory data analysis and statistical methods for prediction.
Together we worked on a project whose effects we would like to share here. Feel free to take a look. :) 
It contains a pdf with the final report and two folders: Heatmaps and App.
  -Heatmaps folder contains files showing the distribution of wines based on various criteria on a map. 
  -App folder contains all the files for the app to work. The application suggests 5 best wines for your preferences.
